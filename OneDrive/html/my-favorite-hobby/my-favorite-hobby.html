<p>My longtime hobby has always been skateboarding.  It has been  
a passion of mine for the past ten years. <br>  
What I like most about skateboarding is the feeling of landing a trick
after many failed attempts. <br> Just below is a video of the process
that goes into a skateboarding trick which lasts just a few seconds.</p>

<p> There are many different media outlets for skateboarding content.
I have listed my favorite ones below.  Learning how to do a skateboarding <br>
trick involves countless tries until you can build the muscle memory to 
repeatedly land the trick without thinking much of it.</p>
